    <p>Stock Up is a mobile application that allows users to create, customize, compare, and interact with their grocery shopping list according to different store locations. Shoppers benefit from an itemized view of the products they need compared to the total cost of their list at a different store location because it helps optimize and expedite their decision making.</p>

      <p class="card-text">Given the responses gathered from the user interviews, it was clear that shoppers had a problem gaining quick access to adequate substitutes when their first choice items were unavailable. The direct competitor in the App Store that most closely resembled Stock Up was Basket. Even though it enabled price comparison, filtering, and shopping list interactivity, it forced the user to select brands before they could see price. It also did not allow the user to add repeat items to a favorites list. Users also commented on a bug where suggested items would replace their selected items and mess up their shopping list.</p>

    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>It was observed that grocery shoppers select stores where they can stay within their budget and minimize travel time. During the COVID-19 pandemic, staple grocery items that are both affordable and good quality quickly go out of stock, which adds to the time spent wandering the store aisles searching for substitutes or blindly visiting multiple stores.</p>

    <p>Completing a cognitive walk-through with the competitor apps would have been useful during the research phase to identify more opportunities and gaps in their user flow. We should have spent more time on creating more of a story arc in our case study by building out the resolution more in a journey map and later in our prototype.</p>
